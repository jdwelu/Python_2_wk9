Python 2 Programming Class - Metro Community College (Assignments)

In this assignment I was tasked with taking a .csv file and updating some of the data. First the program reads the file and displays the data. Then it adds 10%
to the products in the file and displays the data. After that it adds a new product and diplays the data. There was no GUI involved, rather I just tried to 
display the data using the pipe ( | ) as sort of a divider.  

# products.csv
This is the original file.

# updated_products.csv
This is the updated file.
